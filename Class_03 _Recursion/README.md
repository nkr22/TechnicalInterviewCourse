# Class 3 - Recursion
# Update to test forked repo

# a function calls itself so it can keep repeating to get to the value that you want
# base case- the point where you start funneling back up ith the function calls

- 0 (branches^depth)
- 0(2^n)

Iterative approach- a lot more complex and less elegant

interviewer methodology- be professional
